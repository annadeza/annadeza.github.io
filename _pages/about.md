I am currently a fifth-year PhD Student in the [Industrial Engineering & Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) department at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by [Alper Atamt√ºrk](https://atamturk.ieor.berkeley.edu/). 
Previously, I received my BASc in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, where I was advised by [Merve Bodur](https://mervebodur.github.io/).

My research focuses on using discrete optimization to build scalable algorithms for machine learning problems with inherent discrete structures, such as in contexts of interpretability and fairness.

I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market. To view my CV, please click [here](https://annadeza.github.io/files/annadeza.pdf).

I am a Ronald J. and Carol T. Beerman Postdoctoral Fellow in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, working with [Santanu S. Dey](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~sdey30/).

I received my Ph.D. from the [Industrial Engineering & Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) department at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by [Alper Atamt√ºrk](https://atamturk.ieor.berkeley.edu/). 
Previously, I completed my BASc in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, where I was advised by [Merve Bodur](https://mervebodur.github.io/).

I am interested in developing algorithms and strong convex relaxations to improve the scalability of mixed-integer linear and nonlinear optimization problems.
A key area of application is improving the tractability of statistical learning problems with combinatorial constraints.

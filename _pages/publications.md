# Mixed Integer Optimization Formulation for Fair Regression
A. Deza, A. G처mez, A. Atamt체rk. *Under Preparation*

We revisit fair regression from a mixed integer optimization perspective. We present an algorithm to build fair models based on strong convex relaxations of the fair regression problem, and show competitive numerical results on real datasets.

# Logic Rules and Chordal Graphs for Sparse Learning
A. Deza, A. G처mez, A. Atamt체rk. *Under Preparation*

We uncover a new relationship between sparse learning and chordal graphs, and develop a fast clique generation method to improve the
performance of optimization algorithms for $\ell_0$-regularized and $\ell_0$-constrained models.

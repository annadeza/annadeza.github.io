# Two-Phase Framework for Nonlinear Mixed Integer Programs with Indicators
A. Deza, A. Gómez, A. Atamtürk. *Under Preparation*

# Sum-of-Squares Submodularity
A. Deza, G. Hall. *Submitted*.

# Fair and Accurate Regression: Strong Formulations and Algorithms
A. Deza, A. Gómez, A. Atamtürk. *Submitted*. [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17116), [slides](/files/fair_regression_slides.pdf)
<!--
We revisit fair regression from a mixed integer optimization perspective. We present an algorithm to build fair models based on strong convex relaxations of the fair regression problem, and show competitive numerical results on real datasets.

# Logic Rules and Chordal Graphs for Sparse Learning
A. Deza, A. Gómez, A. Atamtürk. [slides](/files/logic_rules_slides.pdf)
<!--
We uncover a new relationship between sparse learning and chordal graphs, and develop a fast clique generation method to improve the
performance of optimization algorithms for $$\ell_0$$-regularized and $$\ell_0$$-constrained models.

# Safe Screening for Logistic Regression with l0-l2 Regularization
A. Deza, A. Atamtürk. *KDIR*. [pdf](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2022/115781/115781.pdf)
<!--
We propose safe screening rules based on lower bounds from the Fenchel dual of strong conic relaxations of the sparse logistic regression problem.

# Simulating Polyculture Farming to Learn Automation Policies for Plant Diversity and Precision Irrigation
Y. Avigal, W. Wong, M. Presten, M. Theis, S. Aeron, A. Deza, S. Sharma, R. Parikh, S. Oehme, S. Carpin, J. Viers, S. Vougioukas, K. Goldberg. *IEEE T-ASE*, 2022.

We present AlphaGardenSim, a fast, first-order, open-access polyculture farming simulator with single plant growth and irrigation models tuned using real-world measurements

# Learning Seed Placements and Automation Policies for Polyculture Farming with Companion Plants
Y. Avigal, A. Deza, W. Wong, S. Oehme, M. Presten, M. Theis, J. Chui, P. Shao, H. Huang, A. Kotani, S. Sharma, R. Parikh, M. Luo, S. Mukherjee, S. Carpin, J. Viers, S. Vougioukas, K. Goldberg. *ICRA*, 2021.

We present a first-order polyculture garden simulator, as well as a physical testbed to tune simulator parameters, laying the groundwork for a fully automated polyculture farming.

# Distance Between Vertices of Lattice Polytopes
A. Deza, A. Deza, Z. Guan, L. Pournin. *Optimization Letters*, 2020.
<!--
We substantiate a conjecture on the maximal diameter of integer polytopes, where the number of facets is replaced by the range of the coordinates of the vertices.
